This repository contains a collection of Java excercises/projects I worked on over the past several months during my java programming courses in school. These projects were originally developed for various assignments and learning exercises, but I’ve only now organized and pushed them to GitHub.

The minor projects cover various concepts, from basic java concepts to object-oriented programming, which I explored as part of my coursework. You’ll find a variety of code examples that demonstrate my understanding of Java and OOP, and I plan to continue improving and expanding these projects in the future.

**Note**: These code was written some time ago in early 2024, I now decided to share them here in a remote repo.
